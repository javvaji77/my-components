# My Components – React + TypeScript

This project is a small front-end assignment built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
It contains two reusable UI components:

1. **Button Component** – A responsive, accessible button with hover and active states.  
2. **Table Component** – A responsive, accessible table to display tabular data.

Both components are designed with **usability**, **reusability**, and **accessibility (ARIA)** in mind.

- Written in **TypeScript** for type safety.
- Fully **responsive** (works on desktop & mobile).
- **Accessible** with ARIA labels.
- Unit tests included with **Jest** + **React Testing Library**.
